# xGmodel

This is a very basic expected goals (xG) model. I scraped some data from the web, and then used it to
train a very small (self-written) neural network that takes in x, y coordinates and shot type to predict the
probablility that a given shot will go in. 

_Go easy on the code - when I started I knew literally zero Python, this was a project I was using to help
teach myself the language_
