(x,y) = (0,0) is top left of pitch

all x coordinates are perpendicular distance from goal line
x axis max is 480
y axis max is 366

y = 366/2 is the middle of the goal

the proba (p) seems to follow this relationship with distance(d)

ln(p) = -0.0286d + 0.02373

therefore: p = exp(-0.0286d)

simulation takes 10 seconds to do 100 iterations
