HAVE TO UPDATE WHEN FOOTBALL DATA FILE HAS BEEN UPDATED AND ONLY THEN. OTHERWISE NUMBERS AND EVERYTHING GETS ALL MUDDLED!!!!!

Ideally should only be run once the new football-data file has been released

first run the shots_scraper_17-18_gameweek.py file. This makes a new file in the Raw folder (important because it then combines everything in this raw folder). This will now also download the new football-data file.

update the remaining fixtures file - at the moment this is done manually

run assign_xG_to_football_data.py - assigns xG numbers to all matches in the football-data 17-18 file

then you can run simulation_17-18.py. This calls the regression parameters from the Simulation Regression folder to calculate estimates for this seasons parameters
